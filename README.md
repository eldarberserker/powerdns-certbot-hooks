## Description
I use PowerDNS for my DNS service. all the scripts are for known DNS services provided by other companies.
I just enabled the WebServer API on my PowerDNS service, and learn how to use the API. 

so using Cloudflare script as base, I modified to the corresponding query formats for PowerDNS API

so each time I request a certificate using certbot, using wildcard and dns to confirm, I don't need to do it manually again.
